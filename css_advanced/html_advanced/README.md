WEBPAGE IMPLEMENTATION BASED ON DESIGN FILE
This repository contains the HTML implementation of a webpage based on a provided design file. The primary goal of this project is to construct the pageâ€™s structure using HTML only, without applying any CSS or styling.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
In this initial phase, the focus is solely on building a clean, semantic HTML layout that mirrors the layout and structure of the Figma design. Styling will be addressed in a later stage.

Completing this project will improve my ability to translate design files into structured web pages and reinforce my understanding of semantic HTML, setting a strong foundation for future styling and responsive design tasks.
